// There are four substring missions that were born all in one day and you shouldnâ€™t
// be needed more than one day to solve them. All of those mission can be simply
// solved by brute force, but is it always the best way to go? (you might not have
// access to all of those missions yet, but they are going to be available with more
// opened islands on the map).

// This mission is the first one of the series. Here you should find the length of
// the longest substring that consists of the same letter. For example, line
// "aaabbcaaaa" contains four substrings with the same letters "aaa", "bb","c" and
// "aaaa". The last substring is the longest one which makes it an answer.

// Input:
//   String.

// Output:
//   Int.
